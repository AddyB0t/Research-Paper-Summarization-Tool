# Research Paper Summarization Tool

## Overview
This project is a Streamlit-based web application that leverages LangChain and OpenAI's language models to automatically generate customized summaries of research papers. Users can select a research paper, specify their preferred explanation style and desired summary length to receive tailored explanations that match their knowledge level and needs.

## Features
- **Paper Selection**: Choose from a collection of significant AI research papers including "Attention Is All You Need", "BERT", "GPT-3", and "Diffusion Models"
- **Customizable Explanation Styles**: Select from multiple explanation approaches:
  - Beginner-Friendly: Simplified explanations with minimal technical jargon
  - Technical: Detailed explanations with appropriate technical terminology
  - Code-Oriented: Explanations that focus on implementation details with code snippets
  - Mathematical: Explanations that highlight the mathematical foundations
- **Adjustable Length**: Control the verbosity of explanations from short summaries to comprehensive breakdowns
- **Mathematical Details**: Relevant equations are included with explanations
- **Intuitive Analogies**: Complex concepts are explained using relatable comparisons

## Technologies Used
- **Streamlit**: Powers the interactive web interface
- **LangChain**: Orchestrates the interaction with language models
- **OpenAI API**: Provides the language model capabilities
- **Python**: Core programming language

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- OpenAI API key

### Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/research-paper-summarization-tool.git
cd research-paper-summarization-tool

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Create a .env file with your OpenAI API key
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here" > .env
```

## Usage
1. Start the Streamlit application:
```bash
streamlit run Research_Paper.py
```
2. Open your web browser and navigate to the URL shown in the terminal (typically http://localhost:8501)
3. Select a research paper from the dropdown menu
4. Choose your preferred explanation style
5. Specify the desired length of the explanation
6. Click "Generate" to create your customized research paper summary

## Implementation Details
The application uses LangChain's prompt templates to format requests to the OpenAI model. The prompt instructs the model to:
1. Summarize the selected research paper
2. Follow the specified explanation style
3. Maintain the requested level of detail
4. Include mathematical equations where relevant
5. Use intuitive analogies for complex concepts

## Example Response
When summarizing "Attention Is All You Need" with a Technical style and Medium length, the system generates a detailed explanation of the transformer architecture, including self-attention mechanisms and their mathematical formulation.

## Limitations
- Summaries are based on the model's training data cutoff
- The system has information about only the pre-selected papers
- Generated summaries should be verified against the original papers for academic use

## Future Enhancements
- Support for PDF upload to summarize any research paper
- Citation extraction and management
- Interactive visualization of key concepts
- Comparison mode between multiple papers
- Export functionality for generated summaries
